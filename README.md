## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Software testing techniques, such as black-box and white-box testing, can help me ensure that my application is functional and secure. Blackbox testing helps ensure an application is functional by focusing on validating external behaviors and user requirements without knowledge of the internal code structure, making it effective for identifying missing functionalities and usability issues. Whitebox testing enhances security by allowing testers to examine and assess the internal code, logic, and pathways, ensuring that vulnerabilities, hidden errors, and potential security flaws are identified and addressed.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can translate user needs into business requirements, such as what kind of service needs to be provided and what characteristics need to be tracked. Then, I can convert those business requirements into classes, variables, and methods within the code. Any requirements, such as the maximum number of characters in a value or whether a value is nullable or not, are translated into input validation within the methods that ensure the requirements are maintained. Finally, I create unit tests that validate that the application correctly delivers the required functionality and meets the user's expectations.

## How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is focused on the needs of the user and a commitment to delivering a correct and accurate product. To ensure success, I review user requirements to eliminate any ambiguity, write efficient and maintainable code, and then perform adequate testing. With this approach, I can develop software that meets the user's expectations, is secure, and stable.
